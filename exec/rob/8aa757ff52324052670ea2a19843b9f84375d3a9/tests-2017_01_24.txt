# This is a checklist. It is written in simple text, mix of [ ] checklist, with trivial "script" for loops
#
# Syntax:
# hash character (#) makes line a comment
#
# variable = something ;
# var_bar = some text ;
# var_foo = something + $var_bar ;
# some_list = item1 , item2 , item3 ;
# for each $loop_variable in $some_list { ..... }
# [...] <- $variable
# [ ] checkbox item
#

# Plan is following:
section.build.native_cygwin = on given OS, build it using the native build method for it
section.build.native_mscv = on given OS, build it using the native build method for it
section.use = using binaries from previous steps, do various use tests
section.break = try to break anything, apply own ideas

download.git = download our code from any git repository ;
download.git.github.com = download from https://github.com/yedino/galaxy42/ ;

runnable = prepare any version of program, see any $build or any $install ;
